You've imported a `HomepageLayout` component from your layouts directory and passed it some SEO data (title and description) as props. \n\nHowever, the body of your `<HomepageLayout>` component is currently commented out, so no content would be visible on the page, only the layout provided by `HomepageLayout` and the SEO tags from the `seo` props would be applied.\n\nIf you intend to display some content, you should include it within the `<HomepageLayout>` tags. For example:\n\n```jsx\n<HomepageLayout seo={seo}>\n    <h1>Welcome to Roos Evers Holistic Skincare</h1>\n    <p>Explore our range of natural skincare products and dive into a world of purity and wellness.</p>\n    <!-- Add more content here as needed -->\n</HomepageLayout>\n```\n\nThis example adds a heading and a paragraph inside your `HomepageLayout` component, which will be displayed on your homepage. You can replace or expand upon this content with whatever you need for your website.\n","messages":[{"id":0,"start":0},{"id":1,"start":1},{"id":2,"start":1043}],"message_metadata":{"0":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2024-04-16T09:11:26.646960+02:00","status":"Done"},"2":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2024-04-16T09:14:57.756760+02:00","status":"Done"},"1":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2024-04-16T09:14:57.756656+02:00","status":"Done"}},"summary":"Adding content to HomepageLayout in Astro file"}
