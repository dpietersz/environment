Please add this code into your `src/pages/afspraak-maken.astro`:\n\n```astro\n---\n// No frontmatter needed for this simple integration.\n---\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Afspraak Maken</title>\n    <style>\n        /* Additional styles can be added here */\n        body {\n            margin: 0;\n            padding: 0;\n            display: flex;\n            justify-content: center;\n            align-items: center;\n            height: 100vh;\n        }\n\n        iframe {\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 100%;\n            border: none;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <iframe src=\"https://widget.treatwell.nl/salon/433225/menu\" \n            frameborder=\"0\"\n            allowfullscreen\n            title=\"Afspraak Maken\">\n    </iframe>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nTo summarize how this works:\n\n- This Astro page is set up with a basic HTML structure.\n- Within the `<head>`, the page's title is set to \"Afspraak Maken\".\n- A small amount of CSS is applied for basic styling. The body's display is set to flex to center the iframe, and the iframe is styled to fill the whole viewport without any border for a cleaner look.\n- The crucial part is the `<iframe>` tag in the `<body>`, where the `src` attribute is set to your given URL (`https://widget.treatwell.nl/salon/433225/menu`). It's configured to fit the full screen and to not have a border.\n\nThis setup ensures that when visitors navigate to the `/afspraak-maken` page on your Astro site, they will see the iFrame loaded with the Treatwell widget for making appointments. Feel free to modify the CSS styling to better fit your webpage's design.\nhow do I make an iframe full width and height using bootstrap css?\n\nTo make an iframe full width and height using Bootstrap, you can utilize the utility classes provided by Bootstrap for managing width, height, and display properties. Given your current setup in Astro and assuming you're using Bootstrap 4 or 5, here's how you can modify your iframe:\n\n```astro\n---\n// Ensure you have Bootstrap included in your project.\n// You can add it in your main layout or directly in this page for demonstration purposes.\n---\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <!-- Include Bootstrap CSS -->\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css\" integrity=\"sha384-JcKb8q3iqJ61gNV9KGb8thSsNjpLGHPIV0CoKDysFAOvhpk8bKo/GiL7Z4gPWZBk\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Afspraak Maken</title>\n    <style>\n        /* Additional optional styles */\n        html, body {\n            height: 100%;\n            margin: 0;\n        }\n        .iframe-container {\n            min-height: 100vh; /* Use vh unit to cover full viewport height */\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div class=\"d-flex justify-content-center align-items-center iframe-container\">\n        <iframe src=\"https://widget.treatwell.nl/salon/433225/menu\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen title=\"Afspraak Maken\"\n            class=\"w-100 h-100\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n\n    <!-- Optional: Include Bootstrap JavaScript plugins -->\n    <script src=\"https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/js/bootstrap.min.js\" integrity=\"sha384-B4gt1jrGC7Jh4AgTPSdUtOBvfO8F6F2PCZx9vON4ReszC4dOWPKGJI2GknGCPFp8\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key changes and additions for making the iframe full width and height:\n\n1. **Bootstrap CSS Link:** Include the Bootstrap CSS in the `<head>` to ensure you have access to Bootstrap's styling and utility classes.\n\n2. **Container Class:** Use a `<div>` with a class of `d-flex justify-content-center align-items-center` surrounding the iframe to make use of Bootstrap's flexbox utility for centering.\n\n3. **Height and Width Utilities**: Add `class=\"w-100 h-100\"` directly to your iframe element to stretch it to full width (`w-100` for 100% width) and full height (`h-100` for 100% height) within its parent container.\n\n4. **Viewport Height Style:** The custom CSS class `.iframe-container` ensures the container takes at least the full viewport height with `min-height: 100vh;`. You may adjust or omit this based on your layout needs.\n\n5. **HTML and Body Height:** To ensure that the page properly calculates heights, setting the `html` and `body` elements to have a height of 100% can help in some scenarios.\n\nUsing Bootstrap's built-in classes and flex utilities will not only achieve the full width and height presentation for the iframe but also ensure responsiveness across different devices.\n","messages":[{"id":0,"start":0},{"id":3,"start":106},{"id":4,"start":1936},{"id":5,"start":2004},{"id":6,"start":4928}],"message_metadata":{"3":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2024-04-17T16:52:25.282763+02:00","status":"Done"},"6":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2024-04-17T16:54:09.070650+02:00","status":"Done"},"4":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2024-04-17T16:52:25.283154+02:00","status":"Done"},"0":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2024-04-17T16:51:31.493961+02:00","status":"Done"},"2":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2024-04-17T16:52:18.801306+02:00","status":"Done"},"1":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2024-04-17T16:52:18.617108+02:00","status":"Done"},"5":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2024-04-17T16:54:09.070266+02:00","status":"Done"}},"summary":"Creating an Astro page with an iframe for a Treatwell widget URL"}
